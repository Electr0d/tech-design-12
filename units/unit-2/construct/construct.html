        <p>
          When I first started working on the Rube Goldberg machine, I didn't really know what I am supposed to do, all I knew was the purpose,
          which is, if you may not know "the consequences of catching the coronavirus". So I started with a ramp with a ball going down the ramp
          and many spheres on the edges of that ramp. When the ball goes down the ramp, it knocks all the spheres and each of them goes into a 
          specific bucket. There were "debt", "death". The problem is that it is very limiting and boring, I have to animate about 40 spheres, and each
          take about 30 minutes to get it somewhat realistic. So I scrapped the project and restarted.

          From the start, I wanted to make an animation that portrays multiple messages, and incorporates easter eggs, by making the main message 
          direct and obvious, and the secondary messages indirect and less obvious unless if you look into the animation closely.

          I started with a plane, then extruded edges up to create walls. I added an HDRI texture with a square light with high intensity to 
          create a late evening feel. I decided to place the window away from the camera so I don't have to model the window frame and curtains, 
          saving me plenty of time.

          I added a dolly camera rig. Which has a very easy way of manipulating camera movement to create amazing cinematic scenes. The base 
          bone moves the entire rig, the outer circle bone moves the camera while keeping the camera facing the target bone. The inner circle 
          bone moves the camera relatively to the outer circle bone, the target bone controls where the camera is looking (x, y, and z rotations).
          At first I set the target bone to follow the ball which resulted in the ball being at the center of the camera all the time, which looked
          odd. So I removed it.

          Immediately after creating the plane, I added a ramp with raised edges, which is actually the same ramp I created from the first iteration.
          I felt like I was falling back in the same trap. So I hid the object and made a table. The table was easy to make, I just added a mirror
          modifier on the x and y axis, which copied exactly what I was modeling, which was the legs, and then I started working on the material.
          The material was the hard part, I wanted it to look somewhat realistic, so I pulled up a reference photo of wood and started with a wave
          texture to represent chisels. I added distortion so the lines are not 100% straight and perfect. Still though, I was not convinced, 
          so I added a noise texture to give the surface little bumps throughout the model, then I changed the wave from lines to radial.

          I then had the idea of stacking books on top of each other to elevate the spheres. So I modeled the books, they were a little tricky
          because I wanted to go for a low-poly count to optimize my scene while making it look like a book. When it was time to add a book cover
          I had the idea of including a secret message with the book, so I picked a book cover for the book "The war on the Uyghurs: China's 
          Campaign Against XinJiang's Muslims".

          Modeling the box itself is very easy. I only created a box, deleted the bottom face, and added a bevel modifier to smooth out the edges.
          The hard part was the motor with the knife attached, I first began with a red button that is connected to the outlet on one end, and 
          the motor on the other end, as soon as the button is pushed, the motor activates and starts spinning, the blade cuts the rope and the box 
          falls on the ball. Modeling the motor itself was rather easy, I just created a cylinder with a subdivision surface modifier to give it 
          smooth edges. So was the rod and the blade. The hard part was animating it. If I set the rotation of the first keyframe to 0Â°, then the 
          second keyframe to 360Â°, the rod wouldn't spin. It was a constant trial and error until I got it right, then I added a cycles modifier 
          to repeat the animation, creating the illusion of spinning.

          Modeling the light switch was simple, since it was really far away from the camera, I didn't have to make it hi-res, so I sticked 
          with a low-poly design to optimize the scene, and because it's easier for me. Then, I modeled a small stick which is a a little
          cuboid with a simple bevel modifier to give it smooth edges. Animating it was a little harder though. I had to animate the box frame by 
          frame as if falls, hits the stick, and spins 360Â°, before landing down on the floor.

          Getting the ball to be pushed out the box was a little tricky, I first thought of making a piston that pushed out the ball, but thought, 
          "how can this be justified?" this is where the idea of the battery popped up. I went back to the box and modelled a battery with wires 
          going out from each terminal, before merging and wiring into the piston and LED light. The battery was held in place with a duct tape. 
          Modelling the tape was easier than expected, just a plane with a solidify modifier to give it a small thickness, and a subdivision surface 
          modifier to smooth out the edges.

            Making the piston was relatively easy, it was just a cylinder with a subdivision surface modifier, and a plate that exerts energy when
            the piston is activated.

          <p>
            The light was made by first cutting a hole through the box by using a boolean. The concept of booleans is explained below. I used a 
            simple cylinder with an emission shader so it would emit light as it beeps.

          This component was the hardest the create. I started with a wooden stand and a laser. The laser was made of a very thin cubiod to imitate
          a laser beam and a spot light, to shine a thicker circle on the ground. The laser module is connected to the outlet on one end, and 
          to a piston on the other I copied the piston design from component 4, resized the cylinder to fit the bucket. and attached it to the 
          bucket using a brace (is that the right word?) and two screws.

          As the piston retracts, opening the bucket trapdoor, and the books fall. Animating the books was 
          tricky. I could've used a physics simulation which would've taken care of the animation for me, but I don't know much about Blender 
          simulations and wanted the most efficient and reliable way, so I animated every book by hand, then I adjusted the timing to make it as 
          realistic as I 
          could. The problem with this approach is that when I rendered prototype 3, the animation was too fast, so I slowed it down a bit, and 
          for some reason the books started clipping into each other as a side effect, which I noticed when I was adding sounds after rendering
          the final animation. The good thing though, is that it goes on fast enough for the viewer not to notice, so I let it slide.

          The bucket is connected to a hanging scale. The design for the hanging scale at first was a simple hanging scale with seven-segment 
          display that reads out the weight of the bucket. But I wanted to include a reference, that's when I got the idea of making BMO from
          "Adventure Time" the hanging scale. So I modeled BMO, and originally I wanted to have BMO grabbing on the hook on one hand, and the 
          bucket on the other hand, but modelling that would take too long, because I have to model BMO's hands, rig them, which is a painful 
          process of going back and forth and checking if the bones work properly and don't make his hands look weird, then pose him. So I 
          decided to make BMO holding the bucket with his feet.
        </p>

        <p>
          I modeled the two faces in Illustrator, I went with a simple design, since you can't really see his face. What you can see though, is that 
          the background transitions from red to green, which signals that the weight reading decreased. I am not very satisfied with the design.

          The books represent the Quality of Life, when the books fall, the weight reading decreases, which represents the Quality of Life 
          decreasing. I copied the books from component 1 and updated the covers. The elements that make up Quality of Life are:
          <ul>
            <li>Emotional Wellbeing</li>
            <li>Health</li>

        This component was a little harder than what I originally anticipated. The idea behind is that the all these spheres turn black as the
        main ball goes through them. I could've added a different material for each ball and made it transition from white to black, but that
        would take too much time. Instead, I thought of making a radial gradient that expands as the ball goes through the spheres, creating
        the illustion that all the spheres are individually animated. Here's the node tree of the material. The video below explains how it works.

          For the final touches I showed the animation to Ms. Kozowy and got feedback on what I should add. She suggested I add text that explains

          Going back and adding the texts was very easy, I placed them on walls, and gave then a linear gradient animation as the component activates
