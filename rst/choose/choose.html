        Introduction

      <div class="answer">
        <p>The designs are very similar to each other so it wouldnâ€™t be worth comparing by most of the criteria. Also comparing using a 26 row table is not very presentable in Google Slides because the viewer is overwhelmed with information at once, also since the scope of the project is big, there are many similarities unlike the phone case design. Therefore, I am going to simplify the process by eliminating similarities and only comparing the differences. The only difference is the space available. Design #2 seems to have more room for the VR setup because the bookcase is tucked away from the computer giving more space.</p>

    <div class="question">
      <div class="prompt">
        Bookshelf Designs
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Bookshelf design #2 looks better than design #1 because it makes a better use of vertical space while having cells instead of rows for a more accurate sorting. The lighting is also a nice addition.</p>
