    <!-- Question 1-->
    <div class="question">
      <div class="prompt">
        1. What is the specific situation exists that causes the problem requiring a solution to be made?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          My bedroom is empty. I do not have much going around to make it nice. I want to design a modern bedroom by incorporating lights, 
          multiple monitors, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          My nightstand is directly on top of a vent which blocks airflow. My room is small and makes poor use of space. There is almost no 
          use of vertical space, which in turn, makes my room seem full, when it is in fact, empty.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am thinking of incorporating all my preivous Tech Design assignments,  in the RST.
