    <!-- Question 1-->
    <div class="question">
      <div class="prompt">
        Prototype
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          The prototype design unfortunately failed to meet many of the requirements set, mainly due to the base 
          material used, which is bristol paper, instead of rubber. Bristol paper was used because the school does 
          not have silicon 3D printers. The prototype does not have a sleek design because trimming bristol paper 
          beyond a certain point will cause it to break in half because of how weak it is. Which meant I could not
           make the design any sleeker. The case does have a rounded design, easily holds on the user’s finger(s),
            comfortable, but is not durable, due to the thin rigid material. The prototype is very cheap to mass 
            produce, costing around $0.5 to produce, is available in multiple colours, and does not slip from the 
            user’s hands, but does not protect the front glass very well, and the tab is inline with the case, it 
            does not stick out.

    <!-- Question 2-->
    <div class="question">
      <div class="prompt">
        Design
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          The design couldn’t be printed, because there is no silicon 3D printer at school. Therefore, I cannot 
          evaluate the design.
