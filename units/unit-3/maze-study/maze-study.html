          Since I didn't have to draw or measure the maze, because the robot moves at an undefined speed, meaning that
          instead, it was a constant
          trial and error, until I got the robot moving through the maze consistently.

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          The Sphero Library works with JavaScript, which is really good for me because I have the most experience in
          programming with JavaScript and
          it is my favourite programming language. So I started out writing my own functions to simplify my workflow.
        </p>


        <div class="header">Colours üé®</div>
        <p>
          I started by writing functions that make me assign the LED colours easily. Then I build on top of it visual
          effects, like the invert VFX.
          I didn't go too far with the idea because I was running out of time and had to start working on the project.
        </p>

        <div class="header">Movement</div>
        <p>
          When I started working on the movement script, I originally wanted to write simple vanilla commands, but, I
          was on the "end" side of the maze,
          and since I am really lazy, I decided to write the script in a way that it executes steps in normal order and
          in reverse order. So that in the
          end, I could make the program execute the commands in reverse order from the "beginning" to the "end" of the
          maze.
        </p>
        <p>
          Writing the code is always easier said than done, and since the Canvas included with the Sphero Edu program
          had very little debug capabilities,
          it was hard to find the problems of my code and fix them. I had to look through my code numerous times to find
          each bug. At the end, though, I
          got the code to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way the code works is that I write steps in a JavaScript object and in each step I define what to do
          (stop, set direction, roll) and
          at what speed if rolling and for how long. The script would go through ever step and execute the command.
        </p>
