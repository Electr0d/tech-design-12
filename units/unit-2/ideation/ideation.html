        Design

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          This design process is going to be recorded and included in the final assignment as a time-lapse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since this design process is component-based, I am creating 2 designs per-component.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am aiming for a more elaborate animation than last time, such as stacking books on top of each other instead
          of using ramps
          that look too good.
        </p>
        <p>
          The books covers are easter eggs intended to convey a message or raise awareness about current crises,
          including the extermination of
          Uyghur Muslims by China, the racial profiling of Middle-Easters, etc.

          This is where it all begins, when the dark ball gets in proximity with the grey ball, it turns black, since it
          is infected.

            This design is made of simple books stacked on top of each other, realistic, but looks cheap. The books
            covers are easter eggs
            , they convey a message or raise awareness about current crises, including the extermination of Uyghur
            Muslims by China.

            Another design I have is to have a simple block that guides the ball along a path when itâ€™s pushed.

          The self-isolating makes the person lose their job since they stop going. I could represent this with:
