        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <div class="question">
          <div class="prompt">
            Introduction
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            In this assignment, I will evaluate the two designs of every component I created. Since each design is simple, I cannot evaluate
            the designs based on the criteria, because said criteria fits the finished Rube Goldberg machine video, not the component. The reason 
            I decided to create 2 designs per component, and not per Rube Goldberg machine is because it would take me too long to create two 
            entirely different animations in this given time frame; still, I would have to create a third design, the best of two worlds.

    <!-- Question 2 -->
    <div class="question">
      <div class="prompt">
        Component 1: getting infected

        <p>
          The books stacked on top of each other makes sense and looks realistic as this is what I would do to elevate something off the table.
          The book name that I chose is "The War on the Uyghurs: China's Campaign Against Xinjiang's Muslims", which conveys a secondary message 
          indirectly, raising awareness about the extermination of Uyghurs.
        </p>

          The ramp looks professional and good, but too good. If I were going to create a physical Rube Goldberg machine, I would look for items
          around my house to use and hand-craft specific tools that I need.
        </p>
        <div class="header">Decision</div>
        <p>
          Design #1 seems like the way to go. It has more depth than a simple ramp.
        </p>

    <!-- Question 3 -->

          Dropping a wood box a wooden box represents the person being forced to stay isolated from outside.

          Same as above. The only problem I have with this design is that It looks horrendous with the Eevee render engine. Using the Cycles
          render engine would fix it, but create another problem. Cycles takes a lot longer to render an image, which is something my computer cannot handle. 
          Each frame (image) takes around 20 minutes to render. The final animation is going to have around 800 - 1200 frames (images), which is going to take
           ~333.33 hours to render.
        </p>
        <div class="header">Decision</div>
        <p>
          I am going to use design #1 because it is more efficient and looks good enough.   
        </p>
      </div>

    <!-- Question 4 -->
    <div class="question">
      <div class="prompt">
        Component 3: lose job

      <div class="answer">
        <div class="header">Design #1</div>
        <p>
          I like the design a lot, but it is just too complicated with many things happening at once, also making the rope fly down is going to 
          take a while because I have to either simulate the rope using rigid bodies which is going about an hour to fully simulate, and is going 
          to add a lot of vertices (points) to my scene and as a result is going to slow me down because the scene is going to be more laggy.
        </p>

        <div class="header">Design #2</div>
        <p>
          Using the box to turn off the switch seems like a quick and easy solution, I only hate how it is just too simple.
        </p>
        <div class="header">Decision</div>
        <p>
          Design #2 is what I'm going with due to simplicity and low cost to performance.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 5 -->
    <div class="question">
      <div class="prompt">
        Component 4: get evicted
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <div class="header">Design #1</div>
        <p>
          I like the idea of having two pistons, one for lifting up the box on one end, the other for pushing the box out. It is very complex
          and cool. ALthough I don't think It's very realistic, because It would be hard to make a component like this in real-life.
        </p>

        <div class="header">Design #2</div>
        <p>
          This idea is interesting, since the box represents the person's house, getting evicted is kicking the ball outside the container, 
          it would be a lot easier to make this, but It won't look as cool.
        </p>
        <div class="header">Decision</div>
        <p>
          This is a tough one, I am thinking of going with design #2. Just because I have very little time, and getting the two pistons, the
          container and battery working convincingly is going to take too much time.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 6 -->
    <div class="question">
      <div class="prompt">
        Component 5: quality of life drops
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <div class="header">Design #1</div>
        <p>
          This is another one of those components with pulleys and ropes, complicated. Yet too costly.
        </p>

        <div class="header">Design #2</div>
        <p>
          This design is more unique, involving  a trap door that swings down as the button is pressed. which is going to be a lot easier to 
          get working.
        </p>
        <div class="header">Decision</div>
        <p>
          Design #2 is the way to go in this one. The design is unique, easy to build and very cheap on performance.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 7 -->
    <div class="question">
      <div class="prompt">
        Component 6: spread the virus to others
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <div class="header">Design #1</div>
        <p>
          This design seems very easy, since I won't have to create paths for each ball to follow. I only need to create a radial gradient in 
          world-space and increase it as the ball goes through the other spheres. Also it makes sense metaphorically, since bystanders will get
          infected when around an infected person
        </p>

        <div class="header">Design #2</div>
        <p>
          Design #2 is a bit harder, since I have to create a bunch of spheres and create a path for each one, then apply a radial gradient in 
          world-space and increase its radius as the ball goes through the other spheres. 
        </p>
        <div class="header">Decision</div>

          Design #2 is the way to go in this one. The design is unique, easy to build and very cheap on performance.

    <!-- Question 8 -->
    <div class="question">
      <div class="prompt">
        Component 7: death is likely if old and have a chronic condition
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <div class="header">Design #1</div>
        <p>
          Turning the ball red is a very simple design, but it is open to many interpretations. On one hand it can leave the viewer thinking
          about what red could mean, but on the other hand, it could make the viewer misunderstand the meaning.
        </p>

        <div class="header">Design #2</div>
        <p>
          Adding a skull decal on the ball makes it very obvious as to what happened, it is not open to interpretations.
        </p>
        <div class="header">Decision</div>
        <p>
          This is a tough one as well. I'm thinking of going with design #1 because it leaves the viewer thinking about the meaning behind the
          shift in colours.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 9 -->
    <div class="question">

      <div class="answer">
        <div class="header">Design #1</div>
        <p>
          Turning the ball gray instead of white is an interesting design, means that the person doesn't feel better than they did

        </p>

        <div class="header">Design #2</div>
        <p>
          Making the ball go randomly, uncontrollably, is also an interesting design. Also implies that the person is not feeling so good,
          although it is not realistic, a ball goes in a straight line, it cannot go on its own randomly.
        </p>
        <div class="header">Decision</div>
        <p>
          Both designs are really good, but I am going with design #1, because design #2 is not very realistic.
