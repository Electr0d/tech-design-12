          I underestimated the amount of time it is going to take to program the sphero robot. I firstly began exploring the Sphero API and trying out different commands. Then, I started building a library so that I can easily make the robot follow steps defined in normal order and in reverse. The problem I ran into is the very limited debugging tool, which delayed me by an entire week.
        </p>
        <p>
          A debugging tool is used to find the source of bugs, it makes fixing bugs a lot easier. The problem with the sphero edu API is that it doesn’t come with a proper debugging tool so finding bugs and fixing them was painful.
        </p>
        <p>
          After I got the code working, I had to work on the path for the robot to follow, which was the hardest part of the maze. It was a constant trial and error. Once every 3-10 trials, I have to recalibrate the sphero robot. All of which ended up taking a lot of time since that process itself is also a trial and error. I finally got the path working but that’s when the RST started, and then the maze path was removed, so all my efforts have gone to waste.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the problems I encountered was when turning, since the ball had one contact surface, it tended to slip rather easily. To counter this, I told the robot to stop, then roll, but for some reason it doesn’t fully stop, then roll. It rather stops rolling for a moment and starts rolling again. I tried to make the bot stop, wait then roll, but realized that it would take me too long to implement it, especially with the horrible debugger provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned to better scope out the time I have and to better manage my time from this assignment. If I were to redo this project, I would hard code everything instead of going on an ambitious project especially since there isn’t much time to work on the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          To conclude, I really liked the programming aspect of the project. Unfortunately I didn’t have much time to explore the API and use it to its full potential. The debugger lacked many tools that caused a delay in finishing my sphero library (code that makes the robot execute steps in normal and reverse order). On the other hand, I hate inconsistencies and uncertainties, which I believe is what led me to take very long to finish the assignment. Constantly recalibrating made the assignment less fun and more of a frustrating experience. All in all, this project taught me one important lesson: not to be too ambitious, especially if I have a deadline to meet.
