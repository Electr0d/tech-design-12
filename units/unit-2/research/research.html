        I already know how to create pulleys, but they are very hard to animate, I might have to animate them frame by frame, 
        which is going to take a while on a bigger scale. I know Blender, including, shading, animation, modelling.

        <p>
          This is the Rube Goldberg machine that I created last year, it has its flaws. For instance, I had no smoke effect on the 
          superconductor, the metal plate on top of the superconductor sticks out, the metal shader doesnâ€™t look realistic, the bulb 
          stand looks weird, and there is no tape on the match, the bulb is not glowing, the video took 3 hours to render, and the video 
          appeared washed out.

            Here's the metal shader on an object, the object doesn't look very mettalic and is perfect which is unrealistic.
             Realistic shaders are not perfect, there are dents, darker spots, etc.</div>

            This is the node tree of the metal shader. As you can see, it is very simple, only applying a gray colour (Base Color). There are no dents, 
            no dark spots, it's literally perfect, which is not realistic.

              The bulb stand above does not look realistic and clips through the bulb. The reason behind this is because I had very little time 
              left to submit the assignment so I made a simple design. This could be solved by remodelling the bulb stand with a completely 
              difference approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              The bulb is not glowing which makes it look odd and unrealistic.
            </p>
            <p>
              The same goes for the match stand. To improve this I would model a small duct tape on top of this and it would solve it easily 
              and make the design a lot more realistic.

            Here's the updated metal shader on an object, I made the edges sharper to better define its dimensions and to give it a bold

            Above is the updated node tree of the metal shader, I made the shader more metallic, added dark spots to create a variation
            in the colour instead of having one base colour, added dents and bumps to the shader to make it imperfect, and therefore, more 
            realistic.
