      <div class="slide-body">Syria is one of the most diverse countries in the world. It is the melting pot of several civilizations, such as the
        Roman, Persian, Islamic, civilizations. It is prodominatly Muslim, with 30% Christians. As mentioned before I was born in Damascus, Syria. I stayed there until the Syrian revolution
        broke out because the crime rate shot up and it was unsafe to live anymore.

      <div class="slide-header">School</div>
      <div class="slide-body">I started going to STFX in September 2018. I joined the computer club almost immediately, but I rarely 
        participated, until the beginning of 2020 where I started learning JavaScript. I got on the team and we were going to a coding
        competition, but the everything came to a halt in the light of the pandemic. That didn't stop me from coding, though. I learned
        C# over the summer! I plan on learning C++ this school year.

      <div class="slide-header">Code</div>
      <div class="slide-body">I love coding. Why? Because I can make my program do the boring stuff for me. For example, instead of 
        memorizing every single password I have, I made a program that stores them in an organized fashion, you just need to memorize 
        one password. The program is called PassVault. I started working on it since January 2020 and finished it in the summer.
        Funnily enough, my friends and family use the program more than I do.
      </div>
      <div class="picture-about">About picture: source-code of the most complex program I've ever written, PassVault. It took me about 7 months to 
        fully develop and is over 3000 lines of code. Written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The program stores passwords in encypted files locally,
        providing the user with the atmost privacy. The program is open-source and avaible on <a href="https://www.github.com/Electr0d/PassVault">GitHub</a>.

      <div class="slide-header">Design</div>
      <div class="slide-body">I also love design. Whether it is creating websites, or 3D designs. You might be asking, "why make websites with code instead of
        having Wix or Google handle it for you?" It is because code gives me more freedom to design the website exactly in the way I envision it. Also Wix and Google add their
        names (usually at the bottom of the website), which I am not a fan of personally.
      </div>
      <div class="picture-about">About picture: I made this when I learned that I have to use my own pictures, or I have to credit them. So 
        I made this design in about 20 mintues with Blender, in class.

      <div class="slide-header">3D Design</div>
      <div class="slide-body">I like to make 3D models. I just love the idea of bringing my imagination to reality through 3D scenes, 
        3D models, etc. I've started learning 3D design back in summer of 2018 when I needed props for a little scene I was making 
        in Unreal Engine 4 (Game Engine), I couldn't find assets for free, so I decided to make my own. Ever since, I've been obsessed with
        designing 3D models whether it is for school assignments, or personal projects. It is the why I'm taking this course.

      <div class="picture-about">About picture: A 3D scene I made last year for my grade 11 Tech Design course. Unfortunately some textures
        are missing ðŸ˜ž</div>

      <div class="slide-header">2D Design</div>
      <div class="slide-body">I am not as interested in 2D models as 3D, but I still work on designing logos, pixel art, etc. from time 
        to time. The reason is that it is not as challenging as 3D design. For example, with 2D design, you can just put boxes on top of
        each other and you got a design, but with 3D design, it's not that easy. The 3D model has to have good topology to be used for
        rigging, shading (texturing), and animation. This is a recurring problem that beginners have to overcome. I've had my fair share of
        models with horrible topology when I first started.

        it just right.</div>

      <div class="slide-header">Animation</div>
      <div class="slide-body">Animations bring objects to life, wether it is icons, 3D models, text, etc. It grabs the user's attention,
        and makes interactions less clunky and more natural. It is why I always use animations in my programs when I'm coding, it brings
        everything to life and makes my programs more professional.
      </div>
      <div class="picture-about">About video: this is the very first 3D animation I've made back in June 2019, it took me around a week to
        complete. The video is choppy because the GIF format don't support 30 FPS for the entire duration of the animation, so it was 
        recorded in 16 FPS.</div>
