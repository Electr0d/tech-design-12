    <!-- Question 1-->
    <div class="question">
      <div class="prompt">
        1. What is the specific situation exists that causes the problem requiring a solution to be made?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Phones fall out of our hands many times, it is inevitable, which is why we usually buy AppleCare when buying our new iPhone 
        so that we can pay a small amount to replace our shattered phone. Some have already thought about this and designed a solution 
        that somewhat works, but makes the phone ugly and bulky. They designed a popsocket that lets you hold your phone without having 
        to worry about it falling as often, but it doesn’t help much, because the phone can still fall easily from your hands if you 
        don’t squeeze your fingers together. The solution is a phone case that holds on your finger instead of your fingers holding on 
        the phone, while keeping the case thin and sleek.

      <div class="prompt">
        2. What is the situation exists that causes the problem requiring a solution to be made?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Everyone who carries a phone needs the solution, it is a benefit regardless of the situation they’re in.

    <!-- Question 3-->
    <div class="question">
      <div class="prompt">
        3. Why is it important to solve this problem?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        It is important to solve this problem, because it sets off many side effects. Firstly, the number of shattered phones is reduced,
         which in turn results in cheaper warranty. Also, it lowers carbon emissions derived from making and shipping replacement phones 
         and phone accessories, such as the charger, earbuds, and phone box; and most importantly, the user no longer has to pay upwards 
         of $700 for a replacement phone.
